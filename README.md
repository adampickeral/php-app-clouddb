Description
===========

This is a template for deploying a PHP application from a git repo under
mod_php on multiple Linux servers with [OpenStack
Heat](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat) on the [Rackspace
Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/), with a [Cloud
Database](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/databases/) back end. This template is
leveraging [chef-solo](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_solo.html) to set up the
server.

Requirements
============
* A Heat provider that supports the Rackspace `OS::Heat::ChefSolo` plugin.
* An OpenStack username, password, and tenant id.
* [python-heatclient](https://github.com/openstack/python-heatclient)
`>= v0.2.8`:

```bash
pip install python-heatclient
```

We recommend installing the client within a [Python virtual
environment](http://www.virtualenv.org/).

Example Usage
=============
Here is an example of how to deploy this template using the
[python-heatclient](https://github.com/openstack/python-heatclient):

```
heat --os-username <OS-USERNAME> --os-password <OS-PASSWORD> --os-tenant-id \
  <TENANT-ID> --os-auth-url https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/ \
  stack-create myphpapp -f php_app_multi.yaml \
  -P repo=https://github.com/MyUser/MyApp.git -P url=http://myapp.org \
  -P db_user=username -P db_pass=wxtRSvbx
```

* For UK customers, use `https://lon.identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/` as
the `--os-auth-url`.

Optionally, set environment variables to avoid needing to provide these
values every time a call is made:

```
export OS_USERNAME=<USERNAME>
export OS_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
export OS_TENANT_ID=<TENANT-ID>
export OS_AUTH_URL=<AUTH-URL>
```

Parameters
==========
Parameters can be replaced with your own values when standing up a stack. Use
the `-P` flag to specify a custom parameter.

* `server_count`: Number of Cloud Servers to deploy (Default: 2)
* `image`: Operating system to use (Default: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise
  Pangolin))
* `flavor`: Server size to use (Default: 4 GB Performance)
* `db_flavor`: Amount of memory for the Cloud Database to use (Default: 1GB
  Instance)
* `db_user`: User name to associate with the Cloud Database (Default: db_user)
* `db_pass`: Password to associate with the Cloud Database (Default:
  none)
* `db_size`: Disk size, in GB, for the Cloud Database (Default: 10)
* `ssh_keypair_name`: Name of the SSH key pair to register with nova (Default:
  none)
* `revision`: Git tag or commit hash that should be deployed (Deafult:
  HEAD)
* `packages`: Comma delimited list of additional system packages to install
  (Default: none)
* `repo`: Specifies a git URL from which to reploy the app (Default: none)
* `url`: Vase url for your application (Default: http://example.com)
* `deploy_key`: Private key to deploy from a private git repo.
* `destination`: Directory into which the application will be installed.
  (Default: /var/www/vhosts/application)
* `public`: URL path on which the application is accessed (Default: /)
* `http_port`: Port where http connections are accepted (Default: 80)
* `https_port`: Port where https connections are accepted (Default: 443)
* `memcached_size`: Amount of memory, in MB, for memcached to use (Default:
  128)

Outputs
=======
Once a stack comes online, use `heat output-list` to see all available outputs.
Use `heat output-show <OUTPUT NAME>` to get the value fo a specific output.

* `private_key`: SSH private that can be used to login as root to the servers.
* `load_balancer_ip`: IP of the Load Balancer created with this deployment.
* `database_id`: UUID of the Cloud Database created.
* `database_hostname`: Hostname for the Cloud Databases instance.
* `server_public_ips`: Public IP addresses of the Cloud Servers created.
* `server_private_ips`: Private IP addresses of the Cloud Servers created.

For multi-line values, the response will come in an escaped form. To get rid of
the escapes, use `echo -e '<STRING>' > file.txt`. For vim users, a substitution
can be done within a file using `%s/\\n/\r/g`.

Stack Details
=============
By default the application will be deployed under /var/www/application

guidelines will be drafted in the near future.
